    # a container or not (and usually this is for the best). One of way is to detect the
    # presence of the `/run/systemd/container` for systems started with systemd (e.g.: Ubuntu),
    # though some distributions (e.g.: Fedora) do not ship their container images with systemd
    # as PID 1. Another way is to check the existence of a `/run/.containerenv` file, for containers
    # run with podman, and `/.dockerenv` file for containers run with docker, though the latter
    # is not always guaranteed to appear.
